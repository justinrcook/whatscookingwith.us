<h2 id="justin-cook">Justin Cook</h2>

<p>Justin is a website developer, working remotely for the Area Education
Agency 267 in Cedar Falls. He writes code and maintains their website
and online tools (and has been with them for 10+ years).</p>

<p>Justin lives up to his name, cooking us meals– spending hours in the
kitchen making nearly everything from scratch. :) Some favorite foods
include hummus, anything with hot sauce and [has converted me to a]
popcorn [lover].</p>

<p>J.R. (short for Justin Roy) also brews beer. He and a small group of
friends used to gather monthly to brew 5-10 gallon batches. IPAs are
his favorite…and I’m sure there will be some on tap in the dining
room kegerator very soon.</p>

<p>Additional random facts that should probably be noted: he loves biking,
enjoys Sci-Fi movies and has a cat named Frank. And he bursts out into
random WOOOOOO OOOOOOOs which never fail to make me smile.</p>

<p>Justin is amazing. It’s him and I and the world, and nothing else matters.</p>

<h2 id="valerie-merchant">Valerie Merchant</h2>

<p>Valerie is a super awesome master [’s degree] designer, maker and crafter.
She creates custom Financial Institution websites for Banno, in the home office as well.</p>

<p>She loves scones, apples strudels… pastries in general, and has a soft
spot for (frosted cake) donuts with sprinkles!!!! (though yeast are clearly
a far superior donut.) She does…THE (Mountain) DEW too. She’s so extreme!!
But they must be seasoned® to ice cold perfection first.</p>

<p>When we stay in, she likes watching Investigation Discovery (&lt;whisper&gt; INVESTIGATE)
among other favorite crime TV shows. Sunday is reserved for Snapped (marathons),
as well as sweets and (Post)secrets!</p>

<p>Merchant! <yelled> is the momma to the cutest dachshund in the world.
He’s named after a typeface (font), Caslon. Him and Frank are, well,
still adjusting to one another...</yelled></p>

<p>Valerie is incredible. I love her, and she is the only one for me.</p>

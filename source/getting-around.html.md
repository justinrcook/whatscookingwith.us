# Getting Around

###### Uber

The taxi alternative&trade; After a
[less than legal start in December '14](http://goo.gl/OqcSDg) Uber will be
(hopefully) back up and [running April 9th](http://goo.gl/ivJ1cC)
ready to pickup and deliver everyone with a super simple app.

###### Car 2 Go

Grab a car and go! They're everywhere...seriously. Sometimes there's two
or more parked near our house. Downside is a $35 registration fee but after
it's $0.41/min with a $15 hour and $85 day max. One of the nice things though
is you can park it and walk away, don't have to pay for parking either.
Although it may be gone by the time you go back to it and you'll have to
find another car (unless you don't end the trip).

If you're thinking about going this option setup an account before making the
trip since there's some setup in getting a members card and something something.

###### Taxi

Good 'ol taxis. Love them...hate them. Most people strongly dislike them
with complaints of being slow but people like to complain too.

###### Rent a Car

Everyone's pretty familiar with this, don't need to explain.

###### Trimet

Public transportation via trains &amp; buses is pretty widespread going just about
anywhere you could want to go. We've heard good things and bad things, mostly
good though. We can't speak personally for Trimet as we've only taken
the Max (train) from the airport one time. Their [website](http://trimet.org/)
has a handy trip planner that provides estimates for time and best route options
to get you where you want to go. There's also an app
([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.trimet.mt.mobiletickets)
, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trimet-tickets/id687943985?mt=8&uo=4"))
where you can plan a trip, buy passes and see where the hell your bus is.

###### Zipcar

While not as popular as Car 2 Go still a good option and the bonus of having
a real car over a Smart card. Rates are around from $7.75/hr and $74/day and
there's a $25 application fee but also a refundable 30 day trial, just saying...

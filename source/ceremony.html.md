### Historical Landing

Construction began on the St. Johns Bridge in September 1929 and was
completed in May 1931. The bridge was built over the Willamette River,
totaling nearly 3,834 feet in length. It is the only steel suspension bridge
in Portland; the main suspension is 1,207 feet long.

In its dedication in June, 1931, reference was made to its beautiful Gothic,
cathedral-like arches, and thus the park beneath found its name. Forty nine
years later, in June of 1980, the Cathedral Park Committee sealed a time
capsule into the stone wall. Measurements for how to find the capsule have
been left with the Oregon History Center. The time capsule will be opened in 2030.

# The Two of Us

## Justin Cook

Justin is a website developer, working remotely for the Area Education
Agency 267 in Cedar Falls. He writes code and maintains their website
and online tools (and has been with them for 10+ years).

Justin lives up to his name, cooking us meals-- spending hours in the
kitchen making nearly everything from scratch. :) Some favorite foods
include hummus, anything with hot sauce and [has converted me to a]
popcorn [lover].

J.R. (short for Justin Roy) also brews beer. He and a small group of
friends used to gather monthly to brew 5-10 gallon batches. IPAs are
his favorite...and I’m sure there will be some homebrew on tap in the dining
room kegerator very soon.

Additional random facts that should probably be noted: he loves biking,
enjoys Sci-Fi movies and has a cat named Frank. And he bursts out into
random WOOOOOO OOOOOOOs which never fail to make me smile.

Justin is amazing. It’s him and I and the world, and nothing else matters.

## Valerie Merchant

Valerie is a super awesome master [’s degree] designer and crafter... designing
and illustrating our wedding invitations too, of course. During the day creates
custom Financial Institution websites for Banno, in the home office as well.

She loves scones, apples strudels... pastries in general, and has a soft
spot for (frosted cake) donuts with sprinkles!!!! (though yeast are clearly
a far superior donut.) She does...THE (Mountain) DEW too. She’s so extreme!!
But they must be seasoned® to ice cold perfection first.

When we stay in, she likes watching Investigation Discovery (&lt;whisper&gt; INVESTIGATE)
among other favorite crime TV shows. Sunday is reserved for Snapped (marathons),
as well as sweets and (Post)secrets!

Merchant! <yelled> is the momma to the cutest dachshund in the world.
He’s named after a typeface (font), Caslon. Him and Frank are, well,
still adjusting to one another...

Valerie is incredible. I love her, and she is the only one for me.

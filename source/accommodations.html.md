# Accomodations

![Flying from Iowa to Oregon!](/images/fly-fly-ia-to-or.png)

## Flights

We've flown to and from the MidWest a handful of times now and have a couple
go-to's when it comes to finding flights. There are direct flights to Portland
(PDX) from Minneapolis (MSP), Omaha (OMA) and Chicago (OHE). If you fly out of
Des Moines (DSM) or other smaller airports, you'll have a connecting flight--
a popular connection is through Denver. A 45 minute layout has been adequate
for us.

And advice for finding cheap flights...

Look into both one way and round trip flights. We've also found cheaper options
by skipping a leg of the flight. What!?... When booking through Delta.com,
it's cheaper to fly from Portland to Des Moines, routing through Minneapolis,
than a direct flight from Portland to Minneapolis. If you're only traveling
with carry-on luggage, you can just take one of the two leg trip.

##### [Hipmunk](https://www.hipmunk.com/)

There's [Hipmunk](https://www.hipmunk.com/) which search option allows you to
chose "plus or minus" one or two days; if your travel time is flexible, you
can compare and alter your trip length or travel days based on the best price.

##### [Skiplagged](https://skiplagged.com/)

This site, [Skiplagged](https://skiplagged.com/) is built just to look for
partial legs of flights, like mentioned above.

We've had good luck with United Airlines as well. Let us know if you need any help!

## Getting Around

##### [Uber](https://www.uber.com/cities/portland)

The taxi alternative&trade; After a [less than legal start in December '14](http://goo.gl/OqcSDg)
Uber will be (hopefully) back up and [running April 9th](http://goo.gl/ivJ1cC)
ready to pickup and deliver everyone with a super simple app.

##### [Car 2 Go](http://portland.car2go.com/)

Grab a car and go! They're everywhere...seriously. Sometimes there's two
or more parked near our house. Downside is a $35 registration fee but after
it's $0.41/min with a $15 hour and $85 day max. One of the nice things though
is you can park it and walk away, don't have to pay for parking either.
Although it may be gone by the time you go back to it and you'll have to
find another car (unles you don't end the trip).

If you're thinking about going this option setup an account before making the trip
since there's some setup in getting a members card and something something.


##### Taxi

Good 'ol taxis. Love them...hate them. Most people strongly dislike them
with complaints of being slow but people like to complain too.

##### Rent a Car

Everyone's pretty familiar with this, don't need to explain.

##### [Trimet](http://trimet.org/)

Public transportation via trains &amp; buses is pretty widespread going just about
anywhere you could want to go. We've heard good things and bad things, mostly
good though. We can't speak personally for Trimet as we've only taken
the Max (train) from the airport one time. Their [website](http://trimet.org/)
has a handy trip planner that provides estimates for time and best route options
to get you where you want to go. There's also an app
([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.trimet.mt.mobiletickets)
, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trimet-tickets/id687943985?mt=8&uo=4"))
where you can plan a trip, buy passes and see where the hell your bus is.

##### [Zipcar](http://www.zipcar.com/portland/)

Feed me zipcar information!!

## Lodging

There is not a centralized space we recommend staying, as the locations of the
ceremony and reception are different. ([Here is a map](http://goo.gl/PO3PHi)
of our home, the ceremony and reception locations for reference.) You can call
around and find something that best suites your trip wish list, but why not try
something more... Portland!?

##### [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)

Rent a room, a floor or a whole house for the duration of your stay. Depending
on the size of your group, renting an Airbnb place can be more cost efficient
than a hotel.

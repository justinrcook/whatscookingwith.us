# Extra Goodies

## Timely happenings in PDX

###### 28th Annual Oregon Brewers Festival

*Tom McCall Waterfront Park*â€” [Get Directions>](https://goo.gl/maps/j1cGX)

The Festival starts on Wednesday, July 22 and goes through Sunday. Taps are
open from noon to 9pm. We definitely recommend going on Wednesday or Thursday...
the weekend gets crazy packed and you'll have to spend all your time waiting in
lines with empty beer cups!

It's cash only; $7 for a glass and $1 per beer token. Everything's sold
separately, so you can share a glass between two people or buy your own,
however you wanna make it happen... It's 4 tokens to fill a glass and 1
token for a 3oz. sample. [oregonbrewfest.com >](http://www.oregonbrewfest.com/)

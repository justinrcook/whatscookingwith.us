# Extra Goodies

## Timely happenings in PDX

###### 28th Annual Oregon Brewers Festival

*Tom McCall Waterfront Park*— [Get Directions>](https://goo.gl/maps/j1cGX)

The Festival starts on Wednesday, July 22 and goes through Sunday. Taps are
open from noon to 9pm. We definitely recommend going on Wednesday or Thursday...
the weekend gets crazy packed and you'll have to spend all your time waiting in
lines with empty beer cups!

It's cash only; $7 for a glass and $1 per beer token. Everything's sold
separately, so you can share a glass between two people or buy your own,
however you wanna make it happen... It's 4 tokens to fill a glass and 1
token for a 3oz. sample. [oregonbrewfest.com >](http://www.oregonbrewfest.com/)

## Recommended Sights & To-Do’s

######  International Rose Test Garden

SW Portland— Get Directions>
The garden grounds are absolutely gorgeous, and feature over 10,000 rose bushes representing more than 650 rose varieties. If you’d like a free guided tour, they do them daily at 1pm, but freely walking the grounds is nice.

###### Kargi GoGo

Downtown Portland— Get Directions>
Justin’s sister and brother-in-law, McKinze Cook and Sean Fredericks, own and run their Peace Coorps inspired Georgian cart, serving food from the country of Georgia. Elements of Eastern European and Middle Eastern cuisines result in fresh, flavorful dishes.

###### Salt & Straw

NorthWest location >  |  Alberta location >  |  Division location >
It began with Kim & Tyler—part luck, part strategy and part love, in a custom push cart creating ice cream recipes. Now, their ice cream is legendary, and people wait in long lines to buy it. You do get all the free samples you want, before picking your flavor(s). We recommend going early, when they open, or whenever you pass by and the line isn’t outside the door.

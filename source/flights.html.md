# Flights

![Flying from Iowa to Oregon!](/images/fly-fly-ia-to-or.png)

We've flown to and from the MidWest a handful of times now and have a couple
go-to's when it comes to finding flights. There are direct flights to Portland
(PDX) from Minneapolis (MSP), Omaha (OMA) and Chicago (OHE). If you fly out of
Des Moines (DSM) or other smaller airports, you'll have a connecting flight--
a popular connection is through Denver. A 45 minute layout has been adequate
for us.

And advice for finding cheap flights...

Look into both one way and round trip flights. We've also found cheaper options
by skipping a leg of the flight. What!?... When booking through Delta.com,
it's cheaper to fly from Portland to Des Moines, routing through Minneapolis,
than a direct flight from Portland to Minneapolis. If you're only traveling
with carry-on luggage, you can just take one of the two leg trip.

###### Hipmunk

Hipmunk's which search option allows you to chose "plus or minus" one or two
days; if your travel time is flexible, you can compare and alter your trip
length or travel days based on the best price.

above.

We've had good luck with United Airlines as well. Let us know if you need
any help!

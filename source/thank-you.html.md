# Thank you!

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly,
I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks
at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! I
meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I
could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Ah, yes!
\John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged
not to go on a killing spree. Negative, bossy meat creature!
